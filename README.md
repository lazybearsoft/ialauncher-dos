IA Launcher (DOS)
=================

**A DOSBox frontend for the [Internet Archive MS-DOS games
collection](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games)**


Forked from https://github.com/rtts/ialauncher

Why I made my own fork: I wanted to make my own modifications, but since I don't play well with others, I prefer to work on my own fork rather than do pull requests to someone else's project.

What modifications are planned:
  1) Make the project compatible with Win XP, because I have a 512mb 32-bit laptop from 2004 that I would like to repurpose into a dedicated game machine. This requires backporting to Python 3.4.4
  2) Minor quality-of-life upgrades, such as better search function and a way to mark and recall favorites.
  3) Create other forks to support other systems such as Atari ST, Amiga, etc.

Why I am well-suited to this project: Decades of professional programming experience, with knowledge of a score of programming languages. I also have a BS in Computer Science.

Why I am ill-suited for this project: I hate the Python programming environment. Not the language itself so much, but everything else about it. Really makes my eyeballs ache anytime I have to struggle to get some random python app working. If I need an app for anything, I always choose apps written in something else, Python is always a last resort. So, it should come as no surprise that my Python skills are noob-level. Also, I am lazy....too lazy to re-write this project from scratch in a proper development environment. 

STATUS
======

This project has been backported to work with Python 3.4.4.
