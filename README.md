IA Launcher (DOS)
=================

**A DOSBox frontend for the [Internet Archive MS-DOS games
collection](https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary_msdos_games)**


Forked from https://github.com/rtts/ialauncher

Why I made my own fork: I wanted to make my own modifications, but since I don't play well with others, I prefer to work on my own fork rather than do pull requests to someone else's project.

What modifications are planned:
  1) Make the project compatible with Win XP, because I have a 512mb 32-bit laptop from 2004 that I would like to repurpose into a dedicated game machine. This requires backporting to Python 3.4.4
  2) Minor quality-of-life upgrades, such as better search function and a way to mark and recall favorites.
  3) Create other forks to support other systems such as Atari ST, Amiga, etc.
